## Synopsis

Show the Local Weather

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

## User Story

User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## Recommendation

We recommend using the Open Weather API. This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.

## Installation

How to set up locally : install jekyll, deploy via surge
## API Reference

https://openweathermap.org/current#geo

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
