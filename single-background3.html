                            <h1>A country of adoption</h1>
                            <p><br>I have worked at Fred & Farid Shanghai, First Digital Independent Agency of the Year according to Ad Age magazine, since January 2016 as a digital producer in the technological department. As a French who was raised in a small town in the North-East of France, my path who led me to China wasn‚Äôt without challenges and risks but all of them were definitely worth considering the fact I am now working in a dynamic industry but most importantly helped me realized my dream: living in China. In fact, before describing my education and professional backgrounds, it is important to understand who I am in a first place in order to why I now live in China.<br><br>
                            I‚Äôve had a happy childhood with hardworking parents that gave me this unique opportunity to travel around the world every year in a different country. Asia, Central America, North America, Europe, Africa, those experiences at my young ages helped me thrilled in my thirst of discovery for other cultures. It was at the age of 13 year‚Äôs old that I started studying more and more the Asian culture, I literally fell in love with it. In High-School, I‚Äôve asked my school director to help me register for Mandarin classes, after some negotiations and a long motivation interview, my school decided to hire a mandarin teacher. At that time, not even 10 000 students were studying mandarin in France, it was then a real challenge to find a teacher, especially in my town were the only immigration in the 60s were from Italy, Poland and Spain as some of my family is from originally.<br><br>
                            My final high school examination in science passed, I chose to leave my hometown and participate in an educational program at the NEOMA BUSINESS SCHOOL called CESEM, the only in France allowing its students to study two years in France business administration then three years in Beijing in order to receive at the end two bachelor degrees, one from NEOMA B.S. and one from my Chinese University. The real challenge with this program was that the university program in China was entirely taught in Mandarin. Apart from living amazing and challenging experiences in Beijing, this period of my life is truly the one that made me who I am today. I‚Äôve learned many valuable life lessons that help me face daily professional challenges. If I wanted to describe what is like to live in China in one sentence, it would be:‚Äù China is like a Roller Coaster, with high and many downs, if you want to live there you need to expect that anything can happened at any time‚Äù.<br><br>

                            But my first three years in China were not only about studying and ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù, it was also a great opportunity to experience many professional experiences. English teacher, French teacher, consultant on Chinese governmental TV, salesman in supermarket during Chinese New Year, waiter, ‚Ä¶ All of them inspiring on many different aspects, but the one that was the most important was a part-time job in the marketing department of a Multi-billionaire Chinese man company that bought many French wine castles in the Bordeaux Area. It was at the moment were the Chinese market was starting to open itself to the consumption of wine, so I was in charge of a city scale (Beijing) project to make special events in-store in order to promote the wine we were selling. I‚Äôve talked about this experience in details in one of my LinkedIn articles, it received many feedbacks from the expat community because it was describing well the Chinese companies intern-communication, government related administrative tasks to perform business activities, and hiring challenges in China.<br><br>
                            After my graduation, I‚Äôve decided to stay in China and move to Shanghai to join a company I had followed for years during my student‚Äôs years: Fred & Farid (FF). A multiple awarded and recognized French advertising agency that took the crazy bet to create an office in China. To me FF is the symbol of digital communication, and even if my studies were not really oriented on this field, I‚Äôve successfully been hired thanks to my unique profile: project manager that can speak French, English and Mandarin. With this set of quality, they placed me in the Technological department. The projects were most of time desktop and mobile websites, apps, servers‚Äô migrations, social based experiences. Working 50 hours a week, I only had time at night to study IT related content as website front-end and back-end development in HTML, PHP, JS and CSS. After six months of night online classes, I‚Äôve successfully launched my own website and project without any assistance from more senior. Because I fell in love with the digital development, I have pursued my studies in this field at night and helped me launch and develop more projects by myself at the point to become the digital producer with the most technical knowledge in my company. With this set of languages, technical, project management skills, I experienced a quick elevation in terms of position and salary within my company giving me the responsibility of projects with more than 100 000 US$ budget, an impressive amount for digital development projects. The First producer to launch a ChatBot and projects involving Artificial Intelligence, my managers at the top level noticed my thirst of learning more and more skills and technological skills. Nowadays during my free time, I am studying Cyber Security to understand more about Penetration Testing which is a field I‚Äôm interesting in. However, I cannot help but notice that one skill was harder to learn than others: management. Even if it comes with experience, I cannot stop but think that studying at your University will help thrive and get to the next level of my professional career.<br><br>
                            I‚Äôve always lived next to people inspiring me that I like to call mentor, my parents helped to understand living in a society, China helped me to surpass myself to face challenge, my colleagues at Fred & Farid helped me to never stop learning even when you‚Äôre not a student anymore, and now IE will help me lead a team more efficiently and guarantee my future projects successes.
